## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/api) - Frontend framework
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - For styles



### What I learned

I learned the new features of Angular 16 and above as I used v14 before. How to use standalone components , signals(), inject() and the new way to implement routing. In addition , I also learned how to fix the new deployment issues with the this version.



### Continued development

With this practice, I will solve the Product Feedback App challenge to add on my portfolio.
